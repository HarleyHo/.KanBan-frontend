# VS Agile

A Kanban App with synchronization and role management, developed with full-stack separation.

## This Project

This project contains the frontend of the application, developed with React.js and Vite.

The project is refactored base on my previous developed project [vue-agile](https://github.com/HarleyHo/vue-agile), trying to change language from Vue.js to React.js.

The frontend is communicating with database on AWS RDS for synchronization via a RESTful API [backend](https://github.com/HarleyHo/vs-agile-backend).
